# Horiseon Challenge

## Description

This is the first challenge project for the UofU bootcamp.  In html you will find a site for a company named Horiseon trying to sell their main functions of their business.  This site essentially serves as a first step for a customer to learn more about this company and what they provide.

## What I Learned

Every moment is something new.  In this exercise I focused on fixing broken links and replacing divs in the html with semantic HTML elements like section and article.  Then I focused on cleaning up the CSS by organizing and consolidating repetitive coding.
